          <h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p>Choosing a path in software development can be difficult. There are a wide variety of paths available, depending on your preference and education. My own path seems to be more common, from what I&rsquo;ve seen scrolling through the internet lately. I was self-taught. No CS degree here. But what this meant was that I had to decided what subjects were important to focus on. I was interested in lots of different things, but I also needed to focus on things that would get me hired. This meant learning web development. These jobs were easier to come by and they were easier to get into.</p>
<p>What I was <em>really</em> interested in was what the big boys had going on. When I started learning, there were people in the industry who were pushing the envelope.  These were the people I was interested in and the reason I wanted to get into technology. I liked building things, but I wanted to build <em>big</em> things. But you don&rsquo;t build big things without a CS degree and at least <em>some</em> software experience. I was coming from the mortgage industry! I had serious Excel skills, sure, but that definitely wouldn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
<p>So, I learned web development. I worked with some Python and some Javascript.  I built plenty of &ldquo;todo&rdquo; apps, blogs, and simple CRUD projects. I showed them off to people and I got a job. It was a good job and I&rsquo;m forever grateful for the opportunity they gave me. It was a foot in the door and I started learning real-world software development <em>fast</em>. But, during my tenure at this position until just recently, something was missing. I was certainly doing enough to get by. I was getting praise at work and delivering results. I was writing code and learning how to write it better. I learned other languages and frameworks and started expanding my skill set. But still, something was missing.</p>
<h2 id="growing">Growing</h2>
<p>There were occasions - not very often, but important when they did arise - when we&rsquo;d be starting something new. Maybe we needed a new service or a new group of services. Maybe it was decided that we needed to rebuild something or start something new from scratch. When my team members or managers discussed these things, I would either be left out or have nothing to contribute. This makes sense. I didn&rsquo;t know the answers here! Learning web development the way I did doesn&rsquo;t teach you what the <em>right</em> way to structure a project is. It doesn&rsquo;t teach you how to <em>properly</em> organize services and architect a project.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve reached the crux of the issue. It&rsquo;s not only that I didn&rsquo;t know the answers in these situations, it&rsquo;s also the <em>value</em> that may have been transferred from that knowledge into the rest of my work. I&rsquo;ve since learned more about software architecture and would be able to contribute in those sorts of discussions. I&rsquo;ve also realized that having a good understanding of software design and architecture is useful in many situations <em>outside</em> of these &ldquo;new project&rdquo; discussions!</p>
<h2 id="the-missing-piece">The Missing Piece</h2>
<p>Simple software architecture patterns such as service decomposition and encapsulation can promote good patterns in many areas of development, not just when designing complex systems. For example, a new front end developer is given a new feature to implement. It involves calling an api, creating some web components, and introducing some new logic. If I was put in this situation near the start of my career, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had any understanding of good design patterns. I would have very likely arranged this code either all in the same place or just wherever <em>seemed</em> right. Quite often, this will not result in code that&rsquo;s easy to maintain, easy to refactor, and easy to contribute to. If instead I had a basic understanding of software design patterns, I may have attempted to separate my code into clearly encapsulated areas. I might have thought it out ahead of time and considered what areas of this feature might be more volatile - more likely to be changed in the future. While good Test-Driven Development practices might help you encapsulate your code, choosing what code to encapsulate and how you should do so can contribute even more to the quality of your project.</p>
<p>Service decomposition and encapsulation are only a small part of good software architecture. But I think they do the best job of pointing out the value that can be brought to a self-taught developer&rsquo;s education, especially near the beginning to middle stages of their career. Spending some time looking into software architecture while also learning how to build that software would create a more well-rounded developer who could bring more value to their work and their team.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>These days, I&rsquo;m spending quite a bit of time thinking about software architecture. I&rsquo;m analyzing different patterns and practices and deciding what seems to be good practice throughout the industry and I believe I&rsquo;ll be sharing some of these discoveries here.  I&rsquo;d like to put together a series of posts which dive into software architecture for self-taught developers and how to present some of the more complex ideas from this subject in a way that&rsquo;s easily digestible and related to the daily work of a software developer in the early stages of their career.</p>
